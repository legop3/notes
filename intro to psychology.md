# the need for science in psychology
- different than philosophy, psychology uses scientific methods to test
- also different than pseudo-psychology

## critical thinking precvents:
- confirmation bias- we look at stuff that confirms our opinion and ignore stuff that doesn't
- bandwagon fallacy- you believe it because everyone else does
- emotional reasoning- "i feel this"
- authority fallacy- "my parents said so" "my teacher said so"
- antiquity fallacy- "we've always done it this way"
- black and white fallacy- believing in the absolutes

## descriptive research
- goal: describing something
    - observation
    - surveys and interviews
        - sometimes people will be socially acceptable instead of being honest about themselves
        - survey construction can be problematic because of framing, or bias
    - case studies
        - also known as a case history
        - when unique aspects of a persons life cant be duplicated in other individuals

- allows a person to get a sense of something
- **answers: what this is**

## corrolational research
- answers relationships between two or more variables
- correlation coefficient
    - -1.00 _< r _< 1.00
    - strength of relationship: magnitude
    - direction of relationship: +/-
- correlations will always follow a positive or negative trend line
- correlation is NOT causation EVER! you cannot imply a cause because of correlation.
- 3rd variable problem
    - ice cream sales go up with murder count
    - in this case, summer is the 3rd variable
- **answers: how do these variables relate**

## experimental research
- hypothesized cause is manipulated
- the independent variable
    - the variable that is manipulated
- the dependent variable (independent = doesn't change)
    - the variable that is the result of manipulating variable
- participants in an experiment:
    - experimental group: participants who recieve the treatment
    - control group: participants who do not recieve the tratment that is the focus of the study
- random assignment: randomly assigning people to each group
- goal: **determine causation**

## science is not a thing, its a method
Scientific method:
1. Ask a question
    - something that you have observed that you want to know more about
2. Conduct a literature search
    - what others have written on your question?
    - if a work is peer reviewed then it generally means it is trustworthy.
    - find the research gap!
3. Sate a hypothesis
    - a testable prediction
    - derived from theory: propose an explanation for proposed events
    - operational definition: a specific definition of a variable: are you alive or dead?
4. Test the hypothesis data
    - who do we collect data from?
    - population: whole range of people on whom a study's research is focused
    - sample: a subset of the population
        - use a large random sample
        - the worst way to do it is a convenience sample
5. Data analysus
    - applies statistical methods to reach a conclusion
    - statistics
        - SPSS
    - interperet the results
    - replication

## ethics in phsychological studies
- research participants have rights
- APA guidelines:
    - informed consent
    - confidentiality
    - deception - dont tell them exactly what youre looking for
    - debriefing - tell them everything youre looking for after
- institutuonal review board (IRB)
