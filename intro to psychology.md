## the big questions:
- nature or nurture?
    - were we born this way or were we made this way?
- change or stability?
    - how do we change our lives? what changes over time? how do we develop? what doesnt change?
- universal or unique?
    - is the stuff aboutus true for everyone? or just us?

## psych's many subfields

    - industrial/organizational psychology: looks into how to make work better for the workers
    - community psychology: looks into the entire community
    - educational psychology
- research psychology - kind of the other side, the research part
    - developmental: looks at the changes throughout our lifespan
    - social: looks at how people relate and influence each other

# the need for science in psychology
- different than philosophy, psychology uses scientific methods to test
- also different than pseudo-psychology

## critical thinking precvents:
- confirmation bias- we look at stuff that confirms our opinion and ignore stuff that doesn't
- bandwagon fallacy- you believe it because everyone else does
- emotional reasoning- "i feel this"
- authority fallacy- "my parents said so" "my teacher said so"
- antiquity fallacy- "we've always done it this way"
- black and white fallacy- believing in the absolutes

## descriptive research
- goal: describing something
    - observation
    - surveys and interviews
        - sometimes people will be socially acceptable instead of being honest about themselves
        - survey construction can be problematic because of framing, or bias
    - case studies
        - also known as a case history
        - when unique aspects of a persons life cant be duplicated in other individuals

- allows a person to get a sense of something
- **answers: what this is**

## corrolational research
- answers relationships between two or more variables
- correlation coefficient
    - -1.00 _< r _< 1.00
    - strength of relationship: magnitude
    - direction of relationship: +/-
- correlations will always follow a positive or negative trend line
- correlation is NOT causation EVER! you cannot imply a cause because of correlation.
- 3rd variable problem
    - ice cream sales go up with murder count
    - in this case, summer is the 3rd variable
- **answers: how do these variables relate**

## experimental research
- hypothesized cause is manipulated
- the independent variable
    - the variable that is manipulated
- the dependent variable (independent = doesn't change)
    - the variable that is the result of manipulating variable
- participants in an experiment:
    - experimental group: participants who recieve the treatment
    - control group: participants who do not recieve the tratment that is the focus of the study
- random assignment: randomly assigning people to each group
- goal: **determine causation**

## science is not a thing, its a method
Scientific method:
1. Ask a question
    - something that you have observed that you want to know more about
2. Conduct a literature search
    - what others have written on your question?
    - if a work is peer reviewed then it generally means it is trustworthy.
    - find the research gap!
3. Sate a hypothesis
    - a testable prediction
    - derived from theory: propose an explanation for proposed events
    - operational definition: a specific definition of a variable: are you alive or dead?
4. Test the hypothesis data
    - who do we collect data from?
    - population: whole range of people on whom a study's research is focused
    - sample: a subset of the population
        - use a large random sample
        - the worst way to do it is a convenience sample
5. Data analysus
    - applies statistical methods to reach a conclusion
    - statistics
        - SPSS
    - interperet the results
    - replication

## ethics in phsychological studies
- research participants have rights
- APA guidelines:
    - informed consent
    - confidentiality
    - deception - dont tell them exactly what youre looking for
    - debriefing - tell them everything youre looking for after
- institutuonal review board (IRB)



## sensation
[transduciton - the process of converting sensory into neural]

absolute threshold - the minimum amount of energy an organism can detect 50% of the time
noise - irrelavent and competing stimuli

sensory adaptation - changes in response to level of stimulus: getting used to loud noise, dark or bright rooms
perceptual consistency - the ability for the brain to maintain the same preception of an object even when conditions around it change
sensory overload - at a point where you have to decide what to pay attention to

# chapter 4 - conciousness

## why do we sleep?
- inactivity theory - we sleep at night to stay out of danger, we stay still at night when we are sleeping
- energy conservation theory - sleep is a way to conserve our energy and save calories.
- restorative theory - allows the body to recharge and recover, redirect energy to restoration
- brain plasticity theory - allows the brian to change and reorganize itself
- evolutionary theory (memory) - consolidating our memories and resting our eyes, our senses are still active while we are asleep

## how does sleep work?
- two stages of sleep, REM and non REM
1. awake
2. stage 1
    - light sleep
    - muscle activity slows
    - occasional muscle twitching
3. stage 2
    - breathing pattern and heart rate slow
    - slight decrease in body tempurature
4. stages 3 and 4
    - deep sleep
    - rhythmic breathing
    - limited muscle activity
    - slow brain waves
5. REM
    - rapid eye movement
    - brain waves speed up and dreaming occurs
    - muscles relax and heart rate increases
    - breathing is rapid and shallow
    - sleep paralasys
    - thought to play an important role in memory

- monophasic sleep: restricted to one period, generally at night
- biphasic: overnight plus an afternoon nap, common in places that are hot, spanish speaking
- polyphasic: several small bursts of sleep througout the day

- age
    - newborns sleep around 16 hours a day
    - 5 years old sleep around 12 hours
    - teens 9 or 10 hours


# chapter 5 - memory

## the information processing model
- encoding (information is converted for storage)
- storage (information is retained in memory)
- reteieval (information is retrieved from memory)









# what is learning?

learning is an almost permanent change in behavior from experiences in life
it is the nurture part of nature/nurture
almost all things are learned from experience

placebo effect
a fake pill or a fake drink

## reinforcement
operant condidionting - if/then statements
"if i ring the bell, i will get food"
working memory is a part of short term memory

semantic memory: trivia and facts
episodic memory: remembers episodes that have played out in your own life

### problem solving vs decision making
- problem solving:
    - find a way to achieve a goal
    - make an answer from scratch
    - urgent most of the time
    - the right answer is needed
    - problems:
        - we are not machines
        - confirmation bias
            - we look for things that we already know
            - ignore everything else
        - framing
            - how is the question asked
            - challenge versus threat
        - affective forecasting
            - affect: how you feel about something
- decision making:
    - choosing between options that are already there
    - answers are already made for you
    - trying to choose the best answer
    





positive reinforcement: the frequency of a behavior increases because it is followed by presentation of something the person wants
negative reinforcement: the frequency of behavior increases because it is followed by the removal of something the person does not want

reinforcement *increases* behavior.


positive punishment: punishment is added, adds something the person doesnt want
negative punishment: takes away something the person does want

punishment *decreases* behavior
