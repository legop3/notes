# chapter 53: the baroque art of europe
- the baroque style was created by catholic patrons who wanted to further show the signifigance of the church.

## baroque images
- divine classical figures could be depicted as people in everyday settings
  - sex
  - violence
  - messy human affairs
- artists began building questions of illusionism into their works
- the calling of saint matthew, michelangelo merisi da caravaggio
  - baroque naturalism
    - dark
    - dramatic
    - vividly realistic
  - shows the moment where matthew gets calledby jesus too follow him
  - depicted humbly
  - it is not entirely obvious which person in the painting is supposed to be matthew
    - this was probably on purpose
    - caravaggio enjoyed visual ambiguity
  - christ and his apostle peter are dressed as humble travelers
- david with the head of goliath, caravaggio
  - goliaths face is a self portrait of caravaggio
    - casting himself as an agressor and a victim
  - david's expression is satisfied and mournful at the same time
  - david's sword says "humility slays pride"
- the elevation of the cross, peter paul rubens
  - shows people lifting the cross with jesus on it
  - triptych (3 panel altarpiece)
    - the three panels show different parts of the story
    - the three panels also share the same horizon line
## looking more closely: iconography in the felicity of the regency
- the felicity of the regency is part of the medici cycle
- they were hung in the luxembourg palace
- this painting symbolically represented the queen's political ambitions
  - the current queen (marie de' medici) was very controversial
  - depicted marie de' medici as the embodiment of new political concepts
- shows marie holding a scale, which is a symbol of justice
- she is also wearing a crown, a symbol of monarchial rule
  - both of these are meant to show that while being a monarch, she is a jsut ruler.
- two figures to the left of the queen
  - a man holding a sickle and a vegetal wreath
    - representing the cycle of life
  - a woman holding an ouroboros (a snake eating it's own tail)
    - representing eternity
- a few putti surrounding the queen
  - one of them yanks on the hair of Envy, and stomps on the head of ignorance
    - ignorance is reaching for the books and instruments just out of her reach
## baroque objects and spaces
- the baroque style is also obvious in sculpture and architecture of the time
- cornaro chapel, gian lorenzo bernini
  - higher ups in the catholic church wanted to communicate their ideals with art
  - bernini created some of the mosr expressive sculpture within this group
- san carlo alle quattro, francesco borromini

  - borromini did the interior and the exterior
    - the inside was one of his first independent architectural commissions
  - he used some existing elements of the church when he redid the interior, especially the fountain
  - at the top of the dome there is a lantern, which is meant to be like the holy spirit
    - a dove inside a triangle on the lantern represents the holy spirit
- altar of the kings, jeronimo de balbas

  - has four estipite columns
  - includes twelve wooden polychrome figures, six male and below them six female saints

  - 357 mirrored panes, and even more window panes

  - venetian glass makers were recruited to build a french glass factory 
    - because the finest glass at the time was made in venice
