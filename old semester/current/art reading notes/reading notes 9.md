## Observing the passing scene
- flaneur/flaneuse
  - a modern sophisticated person who strolls the streets of the city observing the sights and sounds, then they go home and turn it into art or writing
  - maybe the most important part is that they have time to do this
- edgar degas
  - a flaneur
  - went to things like horse races and ballet, then painted quick scenes of these events
  - influinced by photography
    - as photography evolved, people started taking their own random photos without people posing first
    - known as candid photographs
- cab accident, high holborn, london, photo by paul martin
  - paul martin took photos on the streets of london
  - he concealed his camera
  - the photo is literally just a snapshot of the aftermath of a cab accident 
  - the people in the photo arent perfectly framed, not even looking at the camera
  - there are people who are halfway in the frame
## impressionism
- artists in paris created their own exhibitions instead of submitting their work to the state sponsored salon
- the impressionalist exhibitions were somewhat more inclusive to women
- impressionalist artists often painted things as snapshots of action scenes
- they used light colored undercoats for their paintings instead of dark ones
  - this made the colors seem to pop more, and made the whole image brighter
- another thing they would do is actually paint at the scene of the painting, really quick
  - this was made possible by canned paints in tubes and poratble easles
  - they developed different techniques of painting lighting and getting the colors right
    - because the scene was ever changing, they had to do it quicker
- summer's day, berthe morisot
  - painting shows two women sitting in a rowboat on a lake in a park
  - painted it while sitting in the boat with her models
  - quick brushstrokes, not much detail in pure resolution
    - though there are still many small things and details happening
## the rise of art criticism in europe
- the rise of critics critiqueing art
- they wrote sections for pamphlets and newspapers
- both interpreting and describing art
- they also make judgements on the art with reasons to support their opinions
- critics views on what art is:
  - theophile gautier (french)
    - "art for art's sake"
      - means that art exists for the pleasure of the viewer, it does not need to have any other purpose.
  - leo tolstoy (russian)
    - had the opposite view, argued that art had improve society by conveying moral values
  - john ruskin (english)
    - believed that art reflects the culture and society that it came from
    - favored hand craftmanship over mass production
## independent approaches
- artists in europe and north america started to do their own things individually, instead of one style being "correct"
- the banjo lesson, henry ossawa tanner
  - shows a man teaching a boy how to play a banjo
  - he painted it in his studio, and imagined the scene himself
  - two kinds of light, blue daylight and orange or yellow candlelight
  - shows human connection between the man and the boy
- nocturne in black and gold -- the falling rocket, james abbott mcneill whistler
  - whistler believed in "art for art's sake"
  - he was part of the aesthetic movement 
  - the painting shows fireworks against a night sky
  - he used thinned paint to create the water
  - small spots of bright colors represent the fireworks
