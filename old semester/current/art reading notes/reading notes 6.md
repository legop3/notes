# A brief history of the art museum
- the word museum comes from the nine muses
  - the museion of ancient alexandria
    - a university with a library of important things
- there were places in ancient rome where some things were exhibited
## Wunderkammern
- cabinets of wonders
- displays that people would have in their homes
- sometimes a literal cabinet, sometimes a room
  - full of different treasures and things from around the world
- usually owned privately, only really a thing that rich people did
  - shown off to their friends and family
- seen as a reflection of the universe
## the british museum and the enlightenment
- the enlightenment
  - a movement aimed to learn more about the world
  - a guide to modern science
    - proving things based on testing and evidence
  - led by the colonizing europeans
- the british museum began as a gift from sir hans sloane
  - with things from when he was a doctor in the west indian colonies, also some things that he got from other explorers
- the museum was built to resemble a classical temple, which were places of protection and prestige
  - it had an image of britannia, a symbol of the british empire
    - this image showed who controlled the objects inside the museum
- it was like a giant wunderkammer
  - had many obscure objects along with many normal ones
## The rise of museums
- the enlightenment brought museums that were dedicated to art
  - the calitoline (rome)
  - the louvre (paris)
  - the alte pinakothek (munich)
- there were also botanical gardens, plant museums
- zoological gardens, animal museums
- eventually museums had historical objects
  - they were laid out in order, to tell a story of progress over time
    - subdivided by nation or artist
    - this also often led to some art forms being considered more primitive than what european people were used to
## The “white cube”
- in the US, museums werent really a thing until the late 19th century
- the white cube refers to an all white room with art pieces in it
  - this was meant to remove as much distraction as possible
  - "to direct viewers toward a pure experience of the artwork"
- US muesums replicated classical european museums
- the white cube approach might do more harm than good
- john cotton dana
  - rejected the made to order museum
    - museums that replicated classical european museums
  - believed that local museums should serve the local communities
    - with their own art from local artists
    - and their cultures
    - many art museums today are working in this way
