- NOTHING!!
## part a
- structure and function of skeletal muscle
- functions of the muscular system
  - support, stabilization, protection
  - movement
  - regulate body tempurateure by making heat
  - contraction assists in movement within the lymphatic and cardiovascular vessesls
- intro
  - MUSCLES NEVER PUSH, THEY ONLY PULL
  - every skeletal muscle is attached at no less than 2 points
    - origin - attachment to immovable point
    - insertion - attachment to movable point
    - contraction is moving insertion toward origin
- structure of skeletal muscle and contraction
  - muscle fibers / muscle cells
  - sacrolemma - plasma membrane of a muscle cell
  - endoplasmic reticulum - specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum - stores and releases calcium

  - muslce hierarchy:
  - muscle
    - bundles (fassicles)
      - muscle fibers (cells)
        - sarcoplasmic reticulum, surrounding:
          - miofybrils - bundles of myofilaments that run the length of the muscle fiber
          - sarcomere - contractile unit of skeletal muscle, lined up end to end
            - myofilaments - protiens
              - thin filaments - actin
                - at the edges
                - composed mostly of actin
                - also troponin
                - tropomyosin
              - thick filaments - myosin
                - in the center
                - composed of 25 or 30 myosin protiens

- overview of contraction
  - muscles move when nerves tell them to
  - message is transmitted through motor neurons
  - muscles get shorter and pull on bones
  - sarcomere is the contractile unit
  - sliding filament theory of contraction
    - filaments slide past each other during contraction
    - sarcomere shortens
- process of contraction
  1. nerve impulses travel down motor neurons to the neuromuscular junction, where neuron and muscle meet
  2. acetylcholine is released from the neurons and bind to the muscle fibers
  3. the binding of Ach opens Na+ (sodium) channels in the sarcolemma, sodium enters the cells and cause an action potential to travel the sarcolema
  4. action potential causes the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm of the muscle cell
  5. calcium binds to troponin on the thin filament and allows thick filaments to bind to the thin filaments
  6. thick filaments cause thin filaments to slide in towards the center of the sarcomere
  7. ATP is needed to allow the myosin to detach from actin and energize the myosin so it can bind to and move another portion of thin filament

- energy for contraction
  - ATP is the immediate energy source for contraction
  - only enough ATP for 5 or 6 seconds of contraction
  - 3 ways to create more ATP within the muscle cells
    - creatine phosphate
      - skeletal muscle cells contain creatine phosphate
      - converts ADP to ATP
      - provides energy for about 15 seconds
    - anaerobic resperation
      - glycogen
        - used during prolonged exercise
        - stored in muscle tissue as glycogen
        - converted back to glucose
          - then broken down using glycolysis
            - into 2 pyruvic acid and 2 ATP
      - does not use oxygen
      - creates the burning sensation if muscle is not oxygenated, lactic acid
    - aerobic respiration
      - if there is oxygen, pyruvic acid can enter the mitochnondria
      - gets completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water
      - requires oxygen, aerobic respiration
      - every 2 molecules of pyruvic acid can makr 36 ATP molecules
  
  - oxygen debt
    - the amount of oxygen that needs to be taken into the system after exercise
    - to metabolize the lactic acid
    - restore the creatine phosphate supply
    - and reoxygenate myoglobin
      - oxygen binding protien in the muscle tissue
  - muscle fatigue
    - inability of the muscle to maintain strength after prolonged use due to lack of energy
    - happens after repeated stimulation
    - response of lower pH due to lactic acid
