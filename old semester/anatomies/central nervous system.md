## part a
- the brain
  - cerebrum
    - largest part of the brain
    - two cerebral hemispheres
    - contains the lobes
    - the higher brain - personality, thought, learning, memory, language
    - longitudinal fissure divides the cerebral hemispheres
    - transverse fissure divides cerebrum and cerebellum
    - gyri - wrinkles, ridges of tissues, gyrus sincular
    - sulci - grooves in between ridges, sulcus singular
    - cerebral cortex
      - outer part of cerebrum
      - gray matter
        - gray because it contains cell bodies and dendrites
      - organized into 4 lobes
        - frontal lobe
          - at the front of the brain
          - prefrontal cortex - cognitive functions
          - motor cortex - controls skeletal muscles
          - broca's area - motor speech, broca = broken speech
        - parietal lobe
          - at the top rear of the brain
          - general sensory area - from skin and skeletal muscles
          - gustatory area - for taste
        - occipital lobe
          - at the back of the brain
          - visual area - for vision
        - temporal lobe
          - underneath parietal lobe, sticks out the sides of the brain
          - close to the ears
          - auditory area - hearing
          - olfactory area - smell
          - wernicke's area - for understanding words
          - the brain's dictionary
    - cerebral white matter
      - deep to cortex, deep to gray matter
      - contains axons (nerve fibers) of motor neurons
      - white because of myelin on the axons
      - collections of nerve fibers are called tracts
        - share a common function
        - association tracts
          - connect parts of brain together
          - stay within one hemisphere
        - commissural tracts
          - corpus callosum
          - connects 2 hemispheres
        - projection tracts
          - go from brain to spinal cord, descending tract
          - or from spinal cord to brain, ascending tract
          - long distance
    - basal nuclei
      - very deep in cerebrum
      - gray matter (cell bodies)
      - not much known about their function
      - parkinsons effects these, though
      - integrate motor control
      - problems can cause resting tremors, early signs of parkinsons
## part b
  - cerebellum
    - back part of brain
    - balance and motor coordination
    - fine tunes the timing of motor function
    - recieving sensory information and uses it to reduce error in movements
    - proprioception
      - being able to sense the position of your joints
  - diencephalon
    - buried inside brain
    - determines where signals need to go in and out of the brain
    - 3 parts
      - thalamus
        - gateway to the cerebrum, relay station
      - hypothalamus
        - homeostatic functions
        - emotions
        - body tempurature regulation
        - food intake regulation
        - sleep-wake cycles
        - endocrine function
        - produces hormones
          - pituitary gland releases hormones
      - pineal gland / epithalamus
        - poorly understood
        - internal clock
        - produces melatonin, which induces sleep
          - when it gets dark
        - pituitary gland releases the melatonin
  - brain stem
    - stem of brain
    - 3 parts
      - midbrain
        - hearing and visual reflexes
        - cerebral aqueduct - connects 3rd and 4th ventricles of the brain
        - nuclei
      - pons
        - one of the respiratory centers
        - tracts
        - attached to the cerebellum
        - sends information to the cerebellum
      - medulla oblongata!
        - main respiratory centers
        - other visceral centers
          - vomiting
          - defication
- reticular activating system
  - mass of gray matter
  - spans the pons, medulla, midbrain, and part of the diencephalon
  - the system that keeps us mentally alert
  - awake when activated
  - asleep when not activated
  - damage to this system can cause a coma
- limbic system
  - the emotional brain
  - processes and experiences emotions
  - areas of the cerebrum and diencephalon
  - sense of smell sends information here
  - smells are linked to emotions
- spinal cord
  - runs from the base of the brain to the first lumbar vertabra
  - through foramen magnum
  - found within vertebral canal
  - has outer white matter and inner gray matter
  - gray matter
    - butterfly shaped
    - dorsal horn
      - towards the posterior, back
      - top of the butterfly wings
      - sensory neurons
      - dorsal root
        - where the nerve enters the spinal cord
      - dorsal root ganglion
        - lump in the nerves entering the spinal cord
    - ventral horn
      - bottom of the butterfly wings
      - ventral root
        - nerves leaving the spinal cord
  - white matter
    - contains myrlinated tracts (white)
    - aescending tracts - information toward the brain (sensory)
    - descending tracts - information away from the brain (motor)
