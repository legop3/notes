# part a
- consists of
  - lymphatic vessels
    - carry lymph toward the heart
    - open ended system
    - begin as lymphatic capilaries
    - lymph nodes are scattered along lymphatic vessels
      - filters of lymphatic fluid
    - have valves in their walls
    - lymph vessels join to form 2 large ducts
      - thoracic duct
        - from the rest of the body
      - right lymphatic duct
        - only from the upper right side
  - lymphoid organs
- roles of lymphatic system
  - fluid balance
  - dietary fat absorption
    - lacteals
      - absorb fatty products from intestines
  - defense (D-FENS) against disease
    - lymph nodes
      - lymphocytes
      - filter the blood from disease
- what is lymph?????
  - fluid leaves the blood and enters the tissue space
  - fluid left behind in the cells gets taken by lymphatic capilaries
  - interstitial fluid

# part b
- lymphatic organs
  - tonsils
    - rings of lymphatic tissue
    - in throat
    - trap bacteria in food or in air
  - thymus gland
    - in mediastinum
    - involved in the programming of lymphocytes
    - active during youth
    - regresses after youth
  - spleen
    - largest lymphoid organ
    - upper left side of the abdomen
    - lymphocytes and macrophages
    - removes pathogens and destroys old red blood cells
  - peyers patches
    - found along the walls of the intestines
    - prevent bacteria from entering the wall of the intestines
  - lymph nodes
    - filtering organs
    - remove bacteria and tumor cells from lymph fluid
    - lymphocytes and macrophages
    - clusters where:
      - cervical
        - head
      - axillary
        - armpits
      - inguinal
        - hip region
    - swollen = indicate infection
    - a place to find cancer cells if the cancer is traveling through body
