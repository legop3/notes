- anatomy is the structure of the human body
- physiology is the function of the human body

## cell transport

- passive cellular transport
  - high to low concentration
  - simple diffusion
    - movement of molecules across plasma membrane based on a concentration gradient
    - small substances pass through cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration
    - if non polar, they will move easily
    - polar molecules have to move through a channel or pore
    - rate factors
      - nonpolar = more rapidly
      - polar = slower
      - decreased molecular size = faster
      - increased molecular size = slower
  
- facilitated diffusion
  - carrier protiens
    - in the membrane
  - used for larger substances that cannot diffuse simply
  - high concentration to low conentration

- filtration
  - water and or solutes are forced through a membrane 
  - due to a PRESSURE GRADIENT
    - not a CONCENTRATION GRADIENT
  - requires a filter and a pressure gradient

(part 2)

- osmosis
  - passive mechanism
  - passive transport of water through a selectively permeable membrane
  - water concentration is important
  - water moving through the membrane, solute cannot move through the membrane
    - water moves to the area of GREATER solute concentration
  
- osmilarity
  - a measure of the total solute concentration

- tonicity
  - the ability of a solution to influence the tone (shape) of the cell
  - a measure of the concentration of non penetrating solutes
  - 3 types of tonicity solutions
    - isotonic
      - same concentrations as the cell
      - nothing happens to the cell
      - used as IV solutions
    - hypotonic
      - lower concentration than the cell
      - lyses cell (taking on water)
      - cell may burst
      - kill people
    - hypertonic
      - greater concentration than the cell
      - crenates cell (cell losing water)

(part 3)

- active transport mechanisms
- substances move from low concentration to high concentration
- requires energy / ATP
  - pushing a ball up a hill
- uses carriers

- sodium-potassium pump
  - takes potassium into the cell
  - takes sodium out of the cell

- bulk transport
  - the movement of larger quantities of material across the cell membrane
  
  - exocytosis
    - out of the cell
    - packaged molecules, made for export inside a vesicle
      - becomes a part of the cell membrane, releasing particles
  
  - endocytosis
    - into the cell
    - phagocytosis
      - solids
      - cell engulfs a large particle
        - loses some cell membrane
    - pinocytosis
      - fluids
      - taken in by the cell membrane, pinches off, into a vesicle


- water soluble molecules cannot diffuse through the phospholipid layer

## class week 2
- sub
- neuron function
  - action potentials
    - nerve impulse
    - depolarization
      - cells polarity is flipping
      - axon fills with Na+
      - causes the charge to go to +30mV
    - repolarization
      - cells polarity is being reset
      - K+ leaves the axon
      - causes the charge to go back to -70mV
      - refractory period, hyperpolarization happens
        - sodium potassium pumps reset it
  - resting membrane potential
    - at rest, neuron is polarized
    - inside of cell is negative, outside is positive
      - RMP (resting) = -70mV
      - action happens at +30mV
    - more negative particles outside of cell
    - more Na+ in ECF
    - more K+ in ICF
## nueron structure and function
- nervous tissue
  - one of the 4 tissue types
  - neuron
    - the functional units of nervous tissue
    - neuroglia
      - supporting cells of the neurons
        - ex. myelin coating

- three main portions of a neuron
  - cell body
    - the cell, the circle
    - generating and conducting electrical impulses
    - nissil bodies makes protiens
    - biosynthetic center, life source of the cell
    - contains organelles
  - dendrites
    - arms coming off of the cell
    - receptive regions of the neuron
    - the input
    - receptors for neurotransmitters
  - axon
    - the big long
    - generating and unidirectional conducting region
    - initiates and conducts action potentials
  - axon hillock
    - connects the cell body to the axon
    - technically part of the axon
    - beginning of the axon
  - myelin sheath
    - neuroglia
    - produced by oligodendrocytes in central nervous system / brain, spinal cord
    - produced by schwann cells in peripheral nervous system / anywhere else
    - insulates axon from noise
    - nodes of ranvier / gaps in myelin sheath
      - impulses jump between gaps
      - a process called saltatory conduction
  - axon terminal
    - telodendria
      - branches at end of axon
- synapse
  - a synapse is a connection between neurons
    - there is a small space between the neurons
  - a neuromuscular junction is where a nerve meets a muscle cell
    - theres a small space between the telodendria and the muscle cell
- characteristics of neurons
  - live up to 100 years
  - amiotic, does not divide
  - high metabolic rate, in constant need of oxygen and nutrients
  - irritability, able to respond to a stimulus
- the potential
  - the potential to do something
  - in units of mV
- nerve impulses are action potentials
- neurons generate action potentials
- an electrical event involves the flow of ions across the axon cell membrane
- a chemical will transmit to the next cell
- gated channels
  - cell membrane must have selective channels
  - specific for sodium or potassium
  - a chemical (ligand) or a voltage opens the channel
  - chemical gated channels
    - normally closed
    - a chemical opens the channel to flow
  - voltage gated channels
    - normally closed
    - voltage change opens the channel to flow
- resting membrane potential
  - at rest, the inside of the cell membrane is negative, the outside is positive
  - RMP = -70mV
  - polarised membrane
- graded potential
  - quick and short lived change
  - stays in neuron
  - could be less negative
    - ex: -70mV to -50mV
    - depolarization
      - can lead to action potential if it gets to the threshold
        - happens if the potential reaches the hillock
      - voltage gated sodium channels open, positive sodium enters
  - could be more negative
    - ex: -70mV to -90mV
    - hyperpolarization
  - repolarization
    - potassium channels open at +30mV
    - potassium leaves the cell, cell goes back down to -70mV
    - sodium potassium pump brings levels back to normal
      - pumps sodium out and potassium back in
- action potential
  - action potential will send a message to another cell
