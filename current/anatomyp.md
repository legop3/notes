# welcome
- anatomy is the structure of the human body
- physiology is the function of the human body

## cell transport

- passive cellular transport
  - high to low concentration
  - simple diffusion
    - movement of molecules across plasma membrane based on a concentration gradient
    - small substances pass through cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration
    - if non polar, they will move easily
    - polar molecules have to move through a channel or pore
    - rate factors
      - nonpolar = more rapidly
      - polar = slower
      - decreased molecular size = faster
      - increased molecular size = slower
  
- facilitated diffusion
  - carrier protiens
    - in the membrane
  - used for larger substances that cannot diffuse simply
  - high concentration to low conentration

- filtration
  - water and or solutes are forced through a membrane 
  - due to a PRESSURE GRADIENT
    - not a CONCENTRATION GRADIENT
  - requires a filter and a pressure gradient

(part 2)

- osmosis
  - passive mechanism
  - passive transport of water through a selectively permeable membrane
  - water concentration is important
  - water moving through the membrane, solute cannot move through the membrane
    - water moves to the area of GREATER solute concentration
  
- osmilarity
  - a measure of the total solute concentration

- tonicity
  - the ability of a solution to influence the tone (shape) of the cell
  - a measure of the concentration of non penetrating solutes
  - 3 types of tonicity solutions
    - isotonic
      - same concentrations as the cell
      - nothing happens to the cell
      - used as IV solutions
    - hypotonic
      - lower concentration than the cell
      - lyses cell (taking on water)
      - cell may burst
      - kill people
    - hypertonic
      - greater concentration than the cell
      - crenates cell (cell losing water)

(part 3)

- active transport mechanisms
- substances move from low concentration to high concentration
- requires energy / ATP
  - pushing a ball up a hill
- uses carriers

- sodium-potassium pump
  - takes potassium into the cell
  - takes sodium out of the cell

- bulk transport
  - the movement of larger quantities of material across the cell membrane
  
  - exocytosis
    - out of the cell
    - packaged molecules, made for export inside a vesicle
      - becomes a part of the cell membrane, releasing particles
  
  - endocytosis
    - into the cell
    - phagocytosis
      - solids
      - cell engulfs a large particle
        - loses some cell membrane
    - pinocytosis
      - fluids
      - taken in by the cell membrane, pinches off, into a vesicle


- water soluble molecules cannot diffuse through the phospholipid layer
