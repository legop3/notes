        - protien within blood
        - positive = has protien
        - negative = doesnt have protien
    - leukocytes
      - white blood cells
      - larger than red blood cell
      - have a nucleus
      - no hemoglobin

      - fight infection
      - destroy dead or dying cells
      - killing cancerous cells
      - able to leave the blood stream
      - types of white blood cells
        1. granular leukocytes - cytoplasmic granules
           1. neutrophils 
              - most abundant
              - first to respond to infection
              - engulf pathogens (cell eating)
           2. eosinophils
              - increase in number during parasitic worm infections
              - lessen allergic reaction during allergic attack
           3. basophils
              - release histamines, dilates blood vessels
              - release heparin, prevents clotting, promotes blood flow to injured tissue
        2. agranular leukocytes
           1. monocytes
              - largest white blood cells
              - differentiate into macrophages that phagocytize pathogens, old cells
              - can eat cells because they are large
              - stimulate other white blood cells to defend
           2. lymphocytes
              - specific immunity
              - destroy cancer cells
              - brusal or marrow derived = B type
                - produce antibodies
              - thymal derived = T type
                - attack any cell with foreign antigen
      - thrombrocytes

## part b
- hemostasis
  - how we stop bleeding
  - cessation of bleeding
  - 3 steps
  1. vascular spasm
    - constriction of a broken blood vessel to decrease blood loss
    - happens immediately
  2. platelet plug formation
    - platelets adhere to collagen
    - release chemicals that stimulate other platelets and collagen
