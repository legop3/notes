- functions of the nervous system
  - sensory input - nervous system recieves information and sends it to the central nervous system
  - integration - analysis, thinking about the information that comes in, takes place in CNS
  - motor output - instructions are sent from the CNS to muscles or glands that respond
- central nervous system (CNS)
  - brain
  - spinal cord
  - meninges
    - protective membranes of the CNS
    - packaging for the brain and spinal cord
    - 3 layers
      - dura mater - outer most layer, superficial
      - arachnoid mater - middle layer, web-like structure (spider!)
        - subarachnoid space - filled with cerebrospinal fluid
          - cerebrospinal fluid
            - found in and around brain and spinal cord
            - made from blood plasme
            - nourish and protect
            - suspends the brain so it doesnt crush itself
            - in subarachnoid space
            - found in ventricles of the brain
              - produced in lateral ventricles
              - flows from lateral to 3rd
              - flows from 3rd to aquaduct
              - flows to fourth ventricle
              - either gors down the central canal of the spinal cord or to the subarachnoid space
      - pia mater - directly adherent to the brain or spinal cord
        - deepest layer of the meninges
        - touches the brain and spinal cord
  - ventricle
    - spaces within the brain and spinal cord
    - produces CSF
    - allows for the flow of CSF
    - 2 lateral ventricles one per hemisphere
    - third ventricle above thalamus
    - fourth ventricle between cerebellum and pons
    - cerebral aquaduct allows flow between 3rd and 4th ventricle
- peripheral nervous system
  - all nervous tissues outside the brain and spinal cord
  - spinal nerves
    - 31 of them
    - cervical nerves = c1 - c8
    - thoracic nerves = t1 - t12
    - lumbar nerves = l1 - l5
    - sacral nerves = s1 - s5
    - coccygeal nerve = c0
  - cranial nerves
    - 12 of them
  - two divisions of PNS
    - sensory (afferent) nervous system
      - information travels toward CNS from sensors
    - motor (efferent) nervous system
      - information travels away from CNS to outputs
      - two branches
        - somatic nervous system - skeletal muscle output, voluntary
        - autonomic nervous system - smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, involuntary
          - sympathetic nervous system
            - fight or flight response
          - parasympathetic nervous system
            - resting or digesting
