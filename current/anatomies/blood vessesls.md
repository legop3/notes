## structure and function
- 3 layers, walls, tunics
  - tunica intima
    - inner most layer
    - endothilium
  - tunica media
    - middle layer
    - smooth muscle and or elastic tissue
    - can constrict and relax
  - tunica externa
    - outermost layer
    - connective tissue
    - connects blood vessel to surrounding tissue
- arteries
  - thicker walls
  - smaller lumens
  - retain a tubular shape
  - to withstand high pressure
  - (A)LWAYS take blood away from the heart
- veins
  - thinner walls
  - larger lumens
  - flattened shape
  - valves in wall to prevent backflow of blood
  - ALWAYS return blood to the heart
- capillaries
  - exchange materials
  - nutrients, gasses, waste
  - most numerous vessels
- blood pressure
  - force that blood has against blood pressure walls
  - highest in the aorta
  - decreases with distance from left ventricle
  - lowest in vena cava
  - fluctuates between systolic and diastolic blood pressure
  - flow is opposed by resistance
  - BP = CO * TPR
    - CO = HR * SV
  - atherosclerosis
    - plaque builds up in artery wall
    - increased resistance, increased BP
  - pulse
    - expansion of an artery located over a bony area

## arteries and veins
- major arteries
  - ascending aorta
    - coronary arteries
      - supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle
  - aortic arch
    - brachiocephalic trunk
      - arm and head
      - right upper limb, right common caroted artery
    - left common carotid atery
    - left subclavian artery
  - descending aorta
  - thoracic aorta
    - intercostal arteries
    - descending aorta
  - abdominal aorta
    - celiac trunk
      - liver, stomach, pancreas, spleen
    - superior mesenteric artery
      - portions of the intestines
    - renal arteries
      - kidneys
    - gonadal arteries (testicular and ovarian)
    - inferior mesenteric artery
    - common iliac arteries
      - right common iliac
      - left common iliac
    - femoral artery
      - lower limb
- major veins
  - superior vena cava
    - jugular veins
      - neck and head
    - subclavian veins
      - upper limb
      - blood comes from axillary and cephalic veins
    - 2 brachiocephalic veins
      - joins these two ^^
  - thoracic vena cava
    - azygous vein
  - abdominal inferior vena cava
    - hepatic veins
    - renal veins
    - common iliac veins
