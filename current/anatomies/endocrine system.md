## part a
- glands and hormones
- function of the endocrine
  - regulates
    - digestion
    - metabolismm
    - blood pressure / volume
    - calcium balance
    - response to external environment
- endocrine gland
  - secretes into the bloodstream
  - no duct
  - no tube
  - thyroid, adrenal, pituitary
- exocrine gland
  - product excreted 
  - duct
  - tube
  - into an open cavity
  - or onto skin
  - sweat glands, sebaceous glands
- mixed glands
  - has both endocrine and exocrine functioin
  - pancreas, testes, ovary
- hormones
  - secreted into bloodstream
  - by endocrine gland
  - travels to target organ
  - target influinced by the hormone
  - large hormones cannot enter the cell
    - receptors will be on surface of cell
    - hormone has a message for the cell
    - uses a second messenger
    - cAMP
    - receptor > activates g protien > activates enzyme > forms second messenger cAMP
  - some hormones can enter the cell
    - receptor is inside target cell
    - hormone can directly activate DNA
    - testosterone
    - receptor in cell > activates DNA > brings the effect
- major endocrine glands
  - pituitary gland
    - 2 lobes
    - adenohypophysis
      - anterior
      - glandular tissue (epithelial)
      - secretes 6 different hormones
        - TSH - thyroid stimulating hormone, causes thyroid to release thyroid hormone
        - ACTH - adrenocorticotrophic hormone, causes adrenal cortex to release cortisol
        - FSH - follicle stimulating hormone, stimulates egg and sperm development
        - LH - leutinizing hormone, stimulates ovulation or testosterone production
        - growth hormone - stimulates growth of muscles and bones
        - prolactin - stimulates milk production
      - sits in sella turcica
    - neurohypophysis
      - posterior
      - a downgrowth of the hypothalamus
      - stores oxytocin and ADH 
      - ADH - anti diuretic hormone, retain water
      - oxytocin - acts on uterus and mammary glands
## part b
  - thyroid glands
    - influinces metabolism
    - thyroid hormone
      - metabolic hormone
      - increases use of glucose
      - hypothalamus releases TRH > TRH causes anterior pituitary gland to release TSH > TSH causes the thyroid gland to release thyroid hormone
      - calcitonin
        - lowers blood calcium levels
        - causes calcium to be deposited into bone
        - bone sparing hormone
  - parathyroid glands
    - posteroior to thyroid
    - controls calcium
    - 4 small glands in the back of the thyroid glands
    - produce PTH
      - raises blood calcium levels
      - by removing it from bone
      - saving it at kidneys
      - absorbing it from small intestine
      - bone destroying
  - adrenal glands
    - cortex
      - cortisol
        - increases blood glucose
        - inhibits inflammation
      - sex hormones
        - testosterone and estrogen
        - small amounts of both, regardless of gende
        - before puberty
      - aldosterone
        - retains sodium
        - increase blood pressure
    - medulla
      - epinephrine
      - norepinephrine
      - fight or flight responses
  - pancreas
    - mixed gland
    - blood sugar
    - exocrine
      - releases digestive enzymes into small intestine
    - endocrine
      - insulin
        - lower blood sugar levels in bloodstream
        - causes glucose to be taken into cells and liver
        - opens channels in cells
      - glucagon
        - raises blood glucose
        - causes glucose to be released by liver
  - gonads
    - testes
      - male gonad
      - produces testosterone
    - ovaries
      - female gonad
      - estrogen
      - progesterone
        - menstural cycle
