# part a
- sensation 
  - any awareness that you have of the external or internal conditions of the body
  - requires
    - stimulus
    - receptor to detect
    - conduction along a neural pathway
    - integration into a sensation in the brain
  - sensory receptors
    - exteroceptors
      - at or near the surface of the body
      - info about external environment
    - interoceptors
      - blood vessels and viscera
      - info about internal environment
    - proprioceptors
      - info about body position, where your body is in space
      - tendons, muscles, joints, inner ear
  - classification by stimulus detected
    - mechanoreceptors
      - detects pressure, stretching
      - proprioceptors or BP
    - thermoreceptors
      - detects changes in tempurature
    - nociceptors
      - detect pain
      - physical or chemical tissue damage
    - photoreceptors
      - detect light
      - only found in eye
    - chemoreceptors
      - detect chemicals
      - taste, smell, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water
  - general vs special senses
    - general
      - found over a large area of the body
      - touch, pain, tempurature
    - special
      - found in specific organs in the head
      - 5 of them
        - vision
          - 70% of sensory receptors in the body are in the eyes
          - over a million nerve fibers in tracts for eyes
          - only 1/6th of the eye is seen, the rest is in the skull
          - external eye
            - 3 tunics (layers)
              - fibrous tunic = cornea and sclera, white of your eye
                - outer layer
                - cornea is front of eye
                - sclera is white of eye
              - vascular tunic = choroid, ciliary body, and iris, blood supply to eye
                - middle layer
                - choroid wraps around inside of eye
                - ciliary body is muscles
                - iris, is iris.
              - nervous tunic = retina, receptors of optic nerve
                - inside layer
                - retina is the sensory portion of the eye
          - internal eye
            - lens and fluid
              - lens can change shape to focus, becomes thicker
              - called accomidation
              - for close up vision
            - lens divides eye into anterior and posterior segments
              - anterior: aqueous humor (watery fluid)
                - supplies nutrients
                - always being produced
              - posterior: vitreous humor (gel-like fluid)
                - holds retina in place
                - only gets made once, stays forever
        - hearing
        - taste
        - smell
        - equilibrium (balance)
# part b
- process of vision
  - requires focusing light onto the retina
    1. refraction of light
       - bending light rays to bring them together at retina
       - occurs at the cornea and lens
       - hyperopia
         - farsightedness
         - can see far but not near
       - myopia
         - nearsightedness
         - can see near but not far
    2. accomidation of the lens
       - changing the shape of the lens to focus light
       - for near vision
         - lens becomes thicker
         - becomes more rounded
         - ciliary muscles contract
       - for far vision
         - lens is set up for that by default
    3. change in diameter of pupil
       - for far vs close vision
       - constriction
         - for close, bright things
       - dilation
         - for far things
    4. convergence of eyeballs
       - they must look at the same thing
       - on fovea centralis of each eye
       - nervous tunic
       - rods
         - detect light
         - highly sensitive
         - night vision
         - dim vision
         - peripheral vision
       - cones
         - detect (c)olor
         - bright light
         - not very sensitive
  - visual pathway
    - retina has 3 layers of neurons
      - photoreceptors
        - rods and cones
        - closest to choroid layer
      - bipolar
        - in the middle
        - bipolar neurons
      - ganglion
        - closest to vitreous humor
