## part a
- functions of cardiovascular 
  - consists of heart, blood vessels, blood
  - transport to and from cells
  - heart is pump
    - connected to blood vessels
  - blood contains nutrients, waste, resp. gasses
- heart form, size
  - approx. size of closed fist
  - larger in physically active adults
  - bottom point is apex
  - top is base
  - in the pericardial cavity, in the thoracic cavity
- heart has 3 layers
  - endocardium
    - inner layer
    - lining
    - simple squameous epithelium
  - myocardium
    - middle layer
    - cardiac muscle
    - forms the bulk of the heart
    - does the contracting
  - pericardium
    - outer layer
    - surrounds the heart
    - fibrous pericardium
      - prevents the heart from overfilling
      - fibrous sac which encloses heart
      - attaches heart to surrounding tissues
    - serous pericardium
      - also surrounding the heart
      - deeper to fibrous
      - parietal paricardium
      - visceral paricardium (epicardium)
      - delicate layers
      - pericardial fluid (serous fluid) is found between these two^^
        - decreases friction
- the circuits
  - pulmonary circuit
    - right side of heart
    - pumps blood to the lungs
    - short, low pressure circuit
    - oxygenates blood in the lungs
  - systemic circuit
    - left side of heart
    - pumps blood out the aorta
    - to all areas of the body
    - long, high pressure circuit
  - coronary circuit
    - supplies the heart with blood
    - coronary arteries
      - extend from aorta
      - bring oxygenated blood to heart
    - coronary veins
      - take blood from heart 
      - into the right atrium
- anatomy of the heart
  - 4 chambers in the heart
    - 2 upper, called atria
      - right atrium
      - left atrium
      - both recieving chambers
      - thin muscular walls
      - pump into ventricles
    - 2 lower, called ventricles
      - right ventricle
        - pulmonary circuit
      - left ventricle
        - systemic circuit
      - larger
      - pump blood to areas of body
  - valves of the heart
    - prevent backflow of blood to a previous chamber
    - 4 valves
      - 2 atrioventricular (AV) valves
        - lies between atria and ventricles
        - prevent backflow into atria
        - right AV valve
          - tricuspid valve
          - right atria backflow
        - left AV valva
          - bicuspid valve, mitral
          - left atria backflow
        - anchored by chordae tendonae
          - attached to papilary muscle
      - 2 semilunar valves
        - located between ventricles and great vessels
        - prevent backflow into a ventricle
        - aortic semilunar valve
          - between left ventricle and large aorta
          - systemic circuit
        - pulmonary semilunar valve
          - between right ventricle and pulmonary trunk
          - pulmonary circuit
  - heart sounds
    - lub
      - s1
      - closing of atrioventricular valves
    - dub
      - s2
      - closing of semilunar valves
- large blood vessels
  - to the heart
    - right atrium
      - superior vena cava
      - inferior vena cava
      - unoxygenated blood
    - to the left atrium
      - 2 right pulmonary veins
      - 2 left pulmonary veins
      - oxygenated blood
  - exit the heart
  - 2 large arteries
    - pulmonary trunk
      - unoxygenated blood
      - splits into right and left pulmonary arteries
    - aorta
      - largest artery
      - from the left ventricle to all areas of body
      - oxygenated blood
    # arteries ALWAYS take blood away from the heart, veins ALWAYS return blood to the heart
## part b
- pathway of blood, through heart and lungs
  1. deoxygenated blood from vena cavas comes in from right atrium
  2. goes through tricuspid valve
  3. goes into right ventricle
  4. goes from right ventricle up through the pulmonary semilunar valves
  5. goes out the pulmonary trunk and arteries
  6. capillaries in the lungs
  7. once at lungs, blood is now **OXYGENATED**
  8. blood enters pulmonary veins
  9. comes back into heart at the left atrium
  10. from left atrium, goes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventrivle
  11. gets pushed up through the aortic semilunar valve
  12. goes out the aorta to the rest of the body
- heart has 2 phases pf contraction
  - atrial contraction
    - both atria contract at the same time
  - ventricular contraction
    - both ventricles contract at the same time
- cardiac conduction system
  - control of heart rate
    - autonomic nervous system
      - brakes (parasympathetic) and accelerator (sympathetic) to the heart
    - cardiac conduction system
      - created by spedialized tissue
      - initiate contractions with no outside influence
      - heart muscle tissue can create electrical action potentials on its own
    - nodes
      - masses of unique tissue capable of deploarizing at a set rate on its own
      - sinoatrial node (SA)
        - pacemaker of the heart
        - fastest inherint rate of deploarization
        - sends messages faster than any other node
        - influences all of the atria
        - influences the AV node
      - atrioventricular node (AV)
        - delays the impulse to give the atria time to contract
      - AV bundle
      - right and left bundle brances
      - purkinje fibers
        - sends messages down towards the apex
        - to the ventricular walls
        - at the exact same time
- electrocardiogram
  1. atrial depolarization begins
  2. atrial depolarzation completes
  3. ventricular depolarization begins, atria repolarize
  4. ventricular depolarization complete
  5. ventricular repolarization begins
  6. ventricular repolarization complete
  - p wave: depolarization of the atria
  - qrs complex: depolarization of the ventricles
  - t wave: repolarization of the ventricles
- the cardiac cycle
  - the events that occur in a single heartbeat
  - 2 phases
    - systole
      - contracting phase
      - ventricles are conracting, pushing blood out
      - very high pressure
      - pushing blood through AV valves
      - AV valves close so blood doesnt go backwards
        - creating the first heart sound, lub
    - diastole
      - relaxation / filling phase
      - ventricles relax after contraction
      - releases pressure in ventricles
      - blood returns to heart
      - semilunar valves close
        - preventing backflow into ventricle
        - creates second heart sound, dub
      - AV valves open
        - blood flows from atria into ventricle
      - at the end, systole begins again
- regulation of the heart
  - cardiac output (co)
    - volume of blood being pumped out by either ventricle every minute
      - about 5 liters
      - almost all of your blood
  - stroke volume (sv)
    - volume of blood pumped out of each ventricle each beat
