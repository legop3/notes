      - air, food, and water from oral cavity
      - three regions
        - nasopharynx
          - behind the nasal cavity
          - only air comes though here
          - pharyngeal tonsils (adenoids)
          - auditory tube
            - connects to middle ear
        - oropharynx
          - behind oral cavity
          - food, air, drink come through here
          - palatine tonsils
            - commonly removed
          - lingual tonsils
        - larygopharynx
          - behind larynx
          - food, air, drink come through here
          - carries food to esophagus
          - carries air to larynx
    - associated structures
  - lower respiratory tract
    - larynx
      - anterior throat between pharynx and trachea
      - has outer casing
        - 9 cartilages
        - conneted with mucous membranes and ligaments
          - forms attachment for vocal cords
      - 2 pairs of ligaments
        - superior ligaments
          - vestibular folds (false vocal cords)
        - inferior ligaments
          - vocal folds (true vocal cords)
      - epiglottis
        - band of elastic cartilage
        - free flap 
        - bends toward the tongue
        - makes sure food doesnt go down trachea
    - trachea
      - windpipe
      - 16-20 cartilage rings
      - c shaped
      - don't form a ring in the back
    - bronchi
      - bronchial tree
      - right and left primary bronchi
        - branch into secondary
          - branch into tertiary
            - in lungs at this point and below
            - almost 60 levels of branching
              - terminal bronchioles
                - smallest branch
                - no cartilage
                - mostly muscle
                  - constrict during asthma attack
    - lungs
      - alveoli
        - air sacs
        - gas exchange
        - diffusion gradients
        - oxygen in
        - carbon dioxide out
      - right lung
        - 3 lobes
          - superior
          - middle
          - inferior
      - left lung
        - 2 lobes
          - superior
          - inferior
## part b
- lungs
  - right lung is larger than left lung
  - because of heart
  - only right lung has a middle lobe
  - alveoli
    - at base of broncheal tree branches
    - actual sites of gas exchange
- process of breathing
  - ventalation
  - moving air in and out of the lungs
  - inspiration / inhalation
    - diaphgram
    - external intercostals
    - elevate ribs and sternum
    - diaphgram contracts
      - thoracic cavity increases in volume
    - contract external intercostal muscles
      - ribs and sternum elevate
      - increase volume of thoracic cavity
  - expiration / exhalation
    - relaxation of diaphgram
    - relaxation of external intercostals
    - decrease volume
    - release air
  - boyle's law
    - gasses will flow from high pressure to low pressure
    - pressure gradient
    - volume is inversely proportional to pressure
    - where the pressure is low, the air will go :3
- external respiration
  - the exchange of gasses in the lungs
  - oxygen
    - higher concentration in the alveoli
    - diffuses into blood
  - carbon dioxide
    - higher concentration in the blood
    - diffuses from the blood to the alveoli
- gas transport in the blood
  - oxygen transport
    - carried in 2 ways
    - bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells (iron)
    - small amount is dissolved into plasma
  - carbon dioxide transport
    - carried in 3 ways
    - dissolved in plasma
    - combined with hemoglobin
    - most is carried as bicarbonate ions
      - PH balancing systems
      - lungs and kidneys can both regulate
      - co2 + h2o <-> [h2CO3] <-> HCO3- + H+
      -    lungs                   kidneys
- internal respiration
  - exhange of gasses in tissues
  - blood and systemic capillaries
  - oxygen
    - higher concentration in blood
    - diffuses from blood into cells
  - carbon dioxide
    - higher concentration in cells
    - diffuses from cells into blood
