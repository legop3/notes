## part a
- functions
  - gas exchange
    - oxygen in
    - carbon dioxide out
  - regulation of blood pH
    - by changing co2 levels in blood
  - voice production
    - move air past vocal cords
  - olfaction
    - smelling
    - particles pass through nasal cavity
  - innate immunity
    - mucous membranes trap airborne micro organisms
    - also trap dirt, dust, debris
- anatomy of the 
  - upper respiratory tract
    - external nose
      - made of hyaline cartilage, bone, connective tissue, skin
    - nasal cavity
      - extends from nares with septum
      - septum extends to divide all the way to the pharynx
      - hard palate
        - roof of mouth
        - floor of nasal cavity
      - conchae
        - ridges
        - means shelf
        - increase surface area
      - paranasal sinuses
        - air filled sinuses
          - in bone
          - maxillary
          - frontal
          - athmoid
          - sphenoid
          - reduce weight of skull
          - resonate sound
          - nasolacrimal ducts
            - carry tears into nasal cavity
    - pharynx
      - air from the nasal cavit
      - air, food, and water from oral cavity
      - three regions
        - nasopharynx
          - behind the nasal cavity
          - only air comes though here
          - pharyngeal tonsils (adenoids)
          - auditory tube
            - connects to middle ear
        - oropharynx
          - behind oral cavity
          - food, air, drink come through here
          - palatine tonsils
            - commonly removed
          - lingual tonsils
        - larygopharynx
          - behind larynx
          - food, air, drink come through here
          - carries food to esophagus
          - carries air to larynx
    - associated structures
  - lower respiratory tract
    - larynx
      - anterior throat between pharynx and trachea
      - has outer casing
        - 9 cartilages
        - conneted with mucous membranes and ligaments
          - forms attachment for vocal cords
      - 2 pairs of ligaments
        - superior ligaments
          - vestibular folds (false vocal cords)
        - inferior ligaments
          - vocal folds (true vocal cords)
      - epiglottis
        - band of elastic cartilage
        - free flap 
        - bends toward the tongue
        - makes sure food doesnt go down trachea
    - trachea
      - windpipe
      - 16-20 cartilage rings
      - c shaped
      - don't form a ring in the back
    - bronchi
      - bronchial tree
      - right and left primary bronchi
        - branch into secondary
          - branch into tertiary
            - in lungs at this point and below
            - almost 60 levels of branching
              - terminal bronchioles
                - smallest branch
                - no cartilage
                - mostly muscle
                  - constrict during asthma attack
    - lungs
      - alveoli
        - air sacs
        - gas exchange
        - diffusion gradients
        - oxygen in
        - carbon dioxide out
      - right lung
        - 3 lobes
          - superior
          - middle
          - inferior
      - left lung
        - 2 lobes
          - superior
          - inferior
