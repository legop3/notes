- nerves
  - a nerve is a bundle of axons that lie outside the CNS
  - sensory (afferent)
    - toward CNS
  - motor (efferent)
    - from CNS
  - mixed
    - contains axons of both types
    - information moving in 2 directions
  - cranial
    - 12 pairs
      - cranial nerve 1 (I) - olfactory nerve, smell
      - cranial nerve 2 (II) - optic nerve, vision
        - purely sensory
        - extension of retina
        - sent to occipital nerve
      - cranial nerve 3 (III) - occulomotor nerve, motor nerve to move eye
      - cranial nerve 4 (IV) - trochlear nerve, motor to superior oblique muscle, also moves eye
      - cranial nerve 5 (V) - trigeminal nerve, sensory to the face, motor to chewing muscles
      - cranial nerve 6 (VI) - abducens, controls lateral rectus, motor to eye
      - cranial nerve 7 (VII) - facial nerve, mixed, taste, supply muscles for facial expression
      - cranial nerve 8 (VIII) - vestiblocochlear nerve, sensory for hearing and balance
        - 2 branches
          - vestibular nerve
          - cochlear nerve
        - extend from inner ear
      - cranial nerve 9 (IX) - glossopharyngeal nerve, mixed, sensory for taste, motor to throat, salivation
      - cranial nerve 10 (X) - vagus, wanderer, mixed, organs in thoracic and abdominal cavities
        - wanderer
        - innervates
          - broncheals
          - heart
            - slows heart rate
        - turns on digestion
        - turns on urination
      - cranial nerve 11 (XI) - accessory nerve, motor, to neck and back muscles
        - large nerve
        - innervates large neck muscles
        - purely motor
      - cranial nerve 12 (XII) - hypoglossal nerve, controls tongue muscle
    - arising from the brain
    - can be sensory, motor, or mixed
    - most of them supply the head and neck
    - cranial nerve 10 innervates the viscera in thoracic and abdominal cavities

  - spinal
    - plexi
    - 31 pairs
      - arise from spinal cord
      - they are all mixed nerves, carrying both sensory and motor
      - formed by lateral fusion
        - of dorsal or posterior root (sensory)
        - and ventral or anterior root (motor)
      - immediately branch into rami
        - ventral ramus - anterior
          - innervates anterior trunk
        - dorsal ramus - posterior
          - innervates posterior trunk
      - innervates trunk and appendages
      - spinal cord goes from foramen magnum to 2nd lumbar vertebrae
      - more cervical nerves than vertebrae
    - peripheral nervous system
    - spinal nerves are short
    - they are created by a fusion of posterior root and anterior root
      - posterior root contains sensory fibers
      - anterior root contains motor nerve fibers
# part b
- spinal plexi
- ventral ramus
- a plexus is a collection of ventral rami
- there are 4 plexi
  - cervical plexus
    - creates phrenic nerve
      - supplies diaphgram
  - brachial plexus
    - creates median nerve
      - supplies forearm and wrist flexors
  - lumbar plexus
    - creates femoral nerve
      - supplies anterior thigh region
  - sacral plexus
    - creates sciatic nerve
      - supplies posterior thigh
- reflexes
  - an automatic reaction to a stimulus
  - rapid, predictable, involuntary, unlearned, born with them
  - reflex arc
    - nerve pathway of a reflex
    - 5 components
      - receptor - detects stimulus
      - sensory neuron - sends info to CNS
      - integration center - in CNS, links sensory and motor neurons
      - motor neuron - carries info from CNS to effector
      - effector organ - thing that responds to the receptor
  - types of reflexes
    - somatic reflex
      - the effector organ is a skeletal muscle
      - patellar reflex
        - knee jerk reflex
        - patellar tendon is receptor
        - effector is quadriceps muscle
      - flexor reflex
        - muscles that detect injury and contract in response
    - visceral reflex
      - the effector organ is something involuntary
      - smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or gland
      - urination
      - defication
      - blood pressure reflexes
        - receptor = baroreceptor, detects blood pressure
        - sensory neuron = takes BP info to medulla oblongata
        - interneurons in CNS
        - motor oeuron = sympathetic nerve (raise) parasympathetic nerve (lower)
        - effector = heart and blood vessels
