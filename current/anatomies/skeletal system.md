    - occipital bone = posterior, back bottom of head
      - foramen magnum
        - spinal cord hole
      - occipital condyles
        - first vertabrae connects to skull here

      - pointy part
        - crista galli
      - part with holes
        - cribiform plate
        - the smeller
        - olfactory nerves
- sutures
  - joints between the skull bones
  - joints are where two bones meet, these are joints
  
  - between frontal and parietal bones = coronal suture
  - between parietal bones = saggital suture
  - between parietal and temporal = squamous suture
  - between parietal and occipital = lamdoid suture
- sinuses
  - cavities full of air
  - lightens the skull
  - enhances resonance of voice
- foramina
  - foramen magnum - spinal cord hole
  - jugular foramen - jugular hole
  - cartoid canal - for the carotid artery
- fissures
  - slit like structures for eye muscles to pass through
  - superiir orbital fissure
  - inferoir orbital fissure
- facial bones
  - 2 maxillae = upper jaw, behind upper lip, also roof of mouth
  - 2 nasal bones = bridge of nose
  - 2 zygomatic bones = cheekbones
  - 1 mandible = lower jaw, chin
  - 2 lacrimal bones = wall of orbit
  - 1 vomer = inferior part of nasal septum
  - 2 inferior nasal conchae = curved bones in nasal cavity
  - 2 palatine bones = posterior portion of hard palate
  - hyoid bone
    - not connected to any other bone
    - in the fleshy area between neck and mandible
    - does not articulate with other bones
    - used for speech
- axial skeleton
  - vertebral column
  - cervical (7)    
    - neck region
    - atlas
      - attaches to the skull
    - axis
      - 2nd vertabrae
  - thoracic (12)
    - chest area
    - also 12 ribs
  - lumbar (5)
    - lower back
  - sacrum
  - coccyx
    - tailbone
  - parts of vertabrae
    - spinous process
      - the part that sticks out that you feel on your back
    - vertebral foramen
      - hole for the spinal cord in each vertabrae
  - the bony thorax
    - costal cartilage
      - connects ribs to sternum / breastplate
    - sternum = breastbone
    - ribs (12 pairs)
      - true ribs
        - first 7 pairs
        - have individual costal cartilage connecting to sternum
      - false ribs
        - pairs 8 through 12
        - share costal cartilage or don't connect to sternum at all
## part c
