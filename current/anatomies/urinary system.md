pee!!!
## part a
- functions of
  - elimination of waste
    - nitrogen containing wastes
      - creatine
      - uric acid
      - urea
      - ammonium ions
    - water balance
      - kidneys either save water for body
      - or lose water to urine
    - regulation of pH
- anatomy of urinary
  - 2 kidneys
    - produce urine from blood
  - 2 ureters
    - transport urine to bladder from kidneys
  - urinary bladder
    - store urine
  - urethra
    - evacuation of urine
- kidneys
  - 3 distinct regions
    - cortex
      - outer part
    - medulla
      - inner part
    - renal pelvis
      - dilated end of ureter
      - middle of kidney
- kidney blood supply
  - renal arteries
    - from abdominal aorta
    - brings oxygenated blood to kidneys
    - kidneys clean this "dirty blood"
  - renal veins
    - drain deoxygenated blood from kidneys
    - "clean blood" gets returned
    - to inferior vena cava
- microscopic kidney anatomy
  - nephron
    - functional unit of kidney
    - each kidney has about 1 million nephrons
    - consists of
      - glomerulus
        - blood part
        - tuft of blood capillaries
        - afferent arteriole
          - input
        - efferent arteriole
          - output
      - renal tubule
        - 4 portions
          - bowmans capsule
            - the part that the glomerulus sits in
            - like a coffee filter
          - proximal convoluted tubule
          - loop of henle
          - distal convoluted tubule
    - 2 types
      - cortical nephron
        - found in cortex of kidney
        - the majority of the nephrons
        - does not extend
      - juxtamedullary nephron
        - found at junction between cortex and medulla
        - allows for production of concentrated urine
        - extends well into medulla
    - collecting duct
      - collect urine from many nephrons
      - carry it to spaces in kidney
## part b
- urine formation in the nephron
- 3 steps:
  - filtration
    - occurs in glomerulus
    - very high pressure
    - blood goes in afferent
    - gets filtered from pressure
    - blood goes out efferent
  - reapsorption
    - return to blood
    - occurs at proximal convoluted tubule
    - reabsorbs water
    - returns to blood in the peritubular capillaries
  - secretion
    - put into the filtrate
    - occurs in distal convoluted tubule
- hormones in urine formation
  - antidiuretic hormone
    - released when dehydrated
    - causes duct cells to reabsorb water
    - saves water
    - concentrates urine
  - aldosterone
    - increases Na+ reabsorption
    - saves sodium
- micturition
  - process of urination
  - bladder is smooth muscle
  - external urethral sphincter
    - to close urethra
  - internal urethral sphincter
    - smooth muscle
    - involuntary
  - steps of:
    1. as bladder fills, it stretches
    2. bladder sends sensory information to spinal cord
    3. spinal cord sends motor information to muscle of bladder, bladder contracts
    4. spinal cord tells internal urethral sphincter to relax
    5. voluntary control, contracting or relaxing external urethral sphincter
