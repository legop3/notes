# network security fundamentals

## module 1: introduction to security
- what is information security?
  - security is:
    - to be free from danger, which is the goal of security
    - the process that achieves that freedom
  - as security is increased, convenience / avalability is decreased
    - the more secure something is, the less convenient it may become to use
  - information security describes the tasks of securing digital information, whether it is
    - manipulated by a microprocessor
    - preserved on a storage device
    - transmitted over a network
  - three types of information protection (CIA triad)
    - confidentiality   
      - only authorized individuals may access the information
    - integrity
      - ensures information is correct and unaltered
    - availability
      - ensures information is accessible to authorized users
  - information security layers
    - policies and procedures
    - people
    - products
    - inner technical circle of informaion
      - CIA
      - at rest, processed, stored
  - who are the threat actors
    - adversary
    - attacker
    - an entity responsible for cyber incidents against others
  - financial crime is often devided into three categories based on targets
    - individual users --turned into--> at home workers
    - enterprises <-------------------------/
    - governments <------------------------/
  - three types of hackers
    - black hat
      - doing the bad things
      - script kiddies
        - dont really know what theyre doing
        - downloading free automated software and attacking with it
      - hacktivists
        - hacking to promote your ideaology
        - changing contents of a website
      - state actors
        - government employed state owned hackers hacking other countries
      - APT - advanced persistent threat
      - insiders
        - employees, contractors, business partners 
        - harder to recognize
        - spy
        - sabotage
    - white hat
      - ethical hackers
      - do hacky things for good
      - test defenses
      - pen testing
      - all legal
    - gray hat
      - not always bad, not always good
      - you can still go to jail
      - not malicious

## module 2: threat management and cybersecurity resources
- why do pen testing?
- ROE - rules of engagement
- pen testing attempts to exploit vulnerabilities
- the most important element in a pen test is planning (foot)
  - bad or no planning can result in creep, which is an expansion beyond the initial set of the tests limitations
  - bad planning can also create unneeded legal issues
- a scan of a network usually only finds surface problems
  - many network scans are automated, going system to system
- a penetration test can go deeper and attempt to exploit vulnerabilites using manual techniques
- the attacks:
  - must be the same as those used by a threat actor
  - should follow the thinking of threat actors
- who should perform the test? 
  - internal security personnel
    - little or no additional cost
    - tests can be conducted more quickly
    - no contracts needed
    - they already know whats going on
    - can enhance training of employees
    - disadvantages
      - they have inside knowledge
      - bias
      - they will not act like an attacker
      - could have lack of expertise
      - reluctance to reveal
- white box testing
  - attacker knows everything
- black box testing
  - you dont tell the attacker a thing, they have to find everything they want to know
- authorization
  - written approval to conduct the test on all levels
- explotiation level
  - whats off limits? what should they exploit?
- communication
  - initiation - awareness to everybody
  - completion - tell everyone its done
  - incident response? no response = problem
  - status - better with frequent staus updates
  - emergency - critical vulnerbility found, report and pause testing
- cleanup
  - pen tester needs to keep a very good log of what they did
  - they need to undo everything related to the pen test
  - involves removing scripts, back doors, temp files, binaries
  - any cridentials that were changed should be restored
- repoting
  - a report should be generated to document its objectives, methods used, and results
  - a report should be in 2 parts:
    - an executive summary designed for a less technical audience
    - a technical part for the tech teams
