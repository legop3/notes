# stat concepts for business

### variable types
- categorical (qualitative)
  - nominal
    - lowest level of measurment
    - no natural ranking or ordering
  - ordinal
    - values have ranking
    - examples
      - superb, good, unsatisfactory
- quantative 
  - interval
    - differences between values are meaningful
    - 0 is not meaningful
  - ratio (ratio!!!)
    - differences are meaningful
    - 0 is also meaningful
### unit 1: vocabulary
- statistics: the study of data
  
- population: the big group about which we want to gather data from
  - probably not an exact number
  - example: US adults or CSCC students
    - group of people or other subjects
- sample: the smaller subgroup of the population that the information is actually gathered from
  - you have an exact count
  - 100 students from CSCC
  - 1000 US adults
  - sample types
    - simple random sample
      - a method in which every member of the population has an equal oppurtunity to be selected
      - names in a hat, random digit dialing
    - cluster sample    
      - a method where the population is devided into groups, usually already existing groups, such as neighborhoods or classes
      - a number of clusters are randomly selected and every member in the cluster is sampled
      - CSCC survey - a number of classes are randomly selected, everyone in the class takes the survey
    - stratified sample
      - population is devided into demographic groups, then simple random samples are done in proportion to the demographic percentages
      - keeps the demographic structure in your results
      - example, CSCC survey but break it down into first year vs second year students and do surveys in proportion, 75% 1st year vs 25% second year
  - problems with sampling methods
    - these methods considered to be biased, as not everyone has an oppurtinuty to be selected
    - convenience: participants are selected based on ease, first come first serve. studies show that there is biased selection as well.
      - grabbing people off the street as they walk by
    - voluntary response: survey/poll is posted somewhere and people have to write in, log in, do it on purpose in order to respond. usually only people with very strong feelings will bother to do so.
      - surveys on reciepts, ratemyprofessor.com
      - missing the middle ground

- what are we looking for?
  - parameter: information from the population. it may be more descriptive than actually numerical.
    - ex: the number of people who like pepperoni on their pizza
  - statistic: information from the sample. we actually have this information
    - we have it because we picked a sample and asked them the question
    - ex: 75 out of 100 people like pepperoni on their pizza
  - variables: the different types of information that we are gathering from the sample.
    - ex: major, distance traveled, GPA and t-shirt size
    - types of variables
      - quantitative
        - has a numerical value
        - can do mathematical calculations on the values
        - think quantity
        - discrete
          - countable variables, the number of possible values can be counted, usually whole numbers
          - ex: distance traveled, 1 or 3 or 15 miles.
        - continuous
          - any value in a particular range such as any value from 0 to 30 - 1, 1.2, 3.6, 8.89 etc
          - cant count the number of possible values, infinite because they are numbers.
          - ex: GPA
      - qualitative (categorical, word values)
        - cannot have mathematical operations performed on them
        - ex: favorite colors, zip code, street names
          - nominal
            - based on the definitions of the values, there is no natural order in the dataset
            - ex: major, street names
          - ordinal
            - based on the definitions of the values, there is a natural order in the dataset.
            - ex: t-shirt size - small, medium, large, XL
- experiments
  - an experiment has an explanatory veriable that will hopefully show changes in the response variable, which us usually the result. the idea of an experiment is to show there is a positive effect between the two. the explanatory variable is usually the treatment
  - an experiment must have a treatment
  - random comparative experiment
    - the group of subjects will be devided into at least two groups, one group is the control group, which gets the placebo/dummy treatment and is used for comparison to the experimental groups, which are experimented on. you can have more than one experiental group.
  - treatment
    - something that is imposed on the group. it is something (for example, a drug, and exercise, etc) that is not part of their normal existence.
  - blind
    - an experiment is blind when the subject does not know which group theyre in.
  - double blind
    - neither the researcher nor the subject know what group the subject is in
  - block
    - first of all, the subject group is seperated into demographic groups
    - then a random comparative experiment is done in each group

- observational studies
  - no treatment
  - the subjects behavior is not changed (there can be an explanatory varibale and a response variable, but nothing is done to change either)
  - simply observing the subjects
  - prospective
    - a group of subjects is studied into the future throughout their lives
    - ex: a group of kindergarteners until they graduate high school
  - cross sectional
    - information about the group of subjects is gathered at a certain point in time
    - ex: census day at CSCC, they take a snapshot of all the students here.
  - retrospective
    - information about a group of subjects is gathered from past information
    - ex: determening what caused lung cancer

- confounding
  - occurs when the effects of two or more variables cannot be seperated. this can be from variables in the study such as a weight loss study that has exercise and nutrition components. is it the fact that theyre exercising more, or eating better, that theyre losing weight?
  - occurs when there are lurking variables. a lurking variable is a variable that is not studied but may affect either the explanatory or the response variable.
  - we try not to have confounding

- bias
  - bias will skew the results in a particular manner or result. for example, not zeroing a scale causes the weight to be overstated.
  - common types of bias:
    - not having a random sample (such as a simple random sample, straitified, cluster and systematic)
    - voluntary response and convenience are considered to be biased.
    - not doing a random comparative experiment
    - people may not be honest
      - self interest - information is given such that it paints the individual in the best light
      - social acceptability bias - people don't tell the truth because they don't want to be judged.
  - sampling error
    - how the sample is taken
    - certain groups are left out of the sampling frame (list of population to be sampled)
      - ex: people who dont have phones are left out of telephone polls
  - non response error
    - refusal to answer questions

# unit 2
- qualatative - categorical or word values, placed variables into categories
- quantatative - numerical values, that you could use math with.
- frequency - count of the value each time the variable takes that value
  - favorite colors:
    - 2 red
    - 5 green
    - 38 blue
    - 8 yellow
  - relative frequency
    - frequency devided by the total number of values
    - qualatative graphs - example

      FAVORITE COLOR      FREQUENCY     RELATIVE FREQUENCY

      purple                5              5/20=0.35
      blue                  7              7/20=0.35
      green                 4              4/20=0.2
      red                   4              4/20=0.2
      TOTAL                 20     

  - nominal data ^^
  - qualatative data ^^
- pie chart - used for parts of a whole
  - create a circle and mark the pieces. label each piece with the name and frequency or relative frequency.
  - excel will use the relative frequency.
- bar graph
  - can be used for any qualatative data
  - both an x and a y axis. the y axis is what frequency or relative frequency, the x axis is marked with the variable names as seperate bars.
  - a pareto graph will rder the bars in order from highest to lowest
- quantitative graphs
- stem and leaf
  - AKA stem plot
  1. decide how to devide the data. the right most digit is the leaf, and the remaining left are the stem.
  2. create a key to show how the data is devided. make sure we use a value that has different digits.
  3. draw a vertical line. for a single set of data, the stems are on the left and the leaves are on the right. the leaves are in order where the smallest is closest to the stem.
  - repeat instances of the same value (see paper notes packet for example)
- dot plot
  - requires an x axis with a nice even scale. the graph will also require a title. 
  - every graph should have a title that is meaningful.
  - an outlier is a data value that does not appear to belong in the dataset
- quantative graps
- time series (revisited in unit 10)
  - there are two variables (x, y) where x is any unit of time (a day, a month, a year, etc). the y variable is anything else (prices, sales, stocks)
- histogram
  - divide the dataset into classes, every value in the dataset should be in one class and only one class. 
  - after the data set has been divided into classes, count how many values are in each class and that is the frequency of the class
  - the histogram is graphed with frequency (or relative frequency) is on the y axis, and the classes are on the x axis.
  - to calculate classes: (max-min)/# of classes needed -> round up to nearest whole number
  - to find midpoint: (lower bound + next lower bound)/2
  - shapes and distribution: see packet
- how to create a good graph:
  - every graph including the ones in excel should have a title
  - each axis should have a label
  - every axis should have a nice even scale
- pictograms
  - scales that use pictures to illustrate the graph
  - can be very misleading
  - do not use!

# unit 3
9/18
- measures of center
  - tell us where the middle of the data is
  - there are three measures of center
  - mean
    - average
    - see packet
  - median
    - put the observations in order
    - the median is the middle of the list
  - mode
    - the most repeated value
    - note - there can be more than one node
- measures of spread
  - tells us how far apart our data is
  - range
    - maximum value - minimum value
  - variance
    - need to determine where the data is from
    - population variance
    - sample variance
  - standard deviation
  - see packet^^^
- distribution shapes
  - see packet
  - in a symmetric shape, the mean is approxamitley equal to the median (very very close)
  - skewed right = mean is greater than the median
  - skewed left = mean is less than median
- chebychev's rule
  - used for any distrobution
  - you do not need to know the shape
  - see packet
- imperical rule
  - needs a normal or symmetric distrobution
  - mean plus or minus:
  - 1 standard deviation
    - 68%
  - 2 standard deviations
    - 95%
  - 3 standard deviations
    - 99.7%
9/20
- measures of position
  - tells us there in the data a particular observation is
  - z-score
    - tells us how many standard deviations from the mean we are
  - percentiles
    - an observation such that k percent of the data is below the observation, and 100-k percent is above the observation.
  - quartiles
    - percentiles that divide up the data into nice little 25% chunks
    - mainly 2 quartiles
    - second quartile (Q2) is the median
- finding outliers
  - find IQR (inter quartile range)
  - find lower boundary
  - find upper boundary
  - an outlier is anything above or below the upper or lower boundaries
- 5 number summary
  - enter list in stats menu
  - stats -> calc -> 1 var stats
  - last 5 numbers in output are the 5 number summary
    - minX
    - Q1
    - Med
    - Q3
    - maxX
- boxplot (box and whiskers)
  - needs:
    - 5 number summary
    - an X axis with a nice even scale
# unit 4
- probability
  - very important, apparently
  - measures of how likely an event is to occur
  - theoretical
    - this probablilty is determined by either a mathematical model or a mathematical formula
    - ex:
      - a coin has two sides, 1 head and 1 tail, so the probability of a head is 1/2
      - binomial distrobution (unit 5)
  - observed (aka emperical)
    - this probability is calculated by observing events or experiments or simulations
    - you are actually doing something to get real data rather than doing math
    - ex:
      - flipping a coin 100 times and counting h/t
      - car insurance calculations, based on how old you are, where you drive, what you drive
  - personal
    - based on a guess, an opinion, or a feeling
    - not mathematically sound
  - the law of large numbers
    - as the number of observations increases, the observed probability gets closer to the theoretical one
    - ex:
      - more penny flips will get you closer to 50% heads 50% tails
  - sample space
    - a list of all possible outcomes that could occur in a probability problem
    - ex:
      - when rolling a dice, sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    - event
      - any subset of the sample space
      - can be a singular outcome or multiple outcomes
      - ex:
        - rolling a 6 on a die {6}
        - rolling an even number {2, 4, 6}
    - unusual event
      - any event that occurs with a probability of 5% or less
  - probability rules
    - probability is a number between 0 and 1
      - 0 means it will never happen and 1 means it definitely will occur
    - the sum of all probabilities in a sample space adds up to 1
    - complement of A, P(A^c) is the probability that A does not occur
    - see packet for
      - probability rules
      - P(A or B)
      - conditional probability
      - general multiplication rule
        - independence
          - the outcome of the first event does not affect the probability of the second event
    - sampling with replacement
      - independent
      - ex:
        - drawing marbles out of a bag, sampling with replacement means we put the marbles back in the bag so the sample space remains unchanged
    - sampling without replacement
      - dependent
      - ex:
        - drawing marbles out of a bag, sampling without replacement means that we do not put the marbles back in the bag, so the sample space is changed
    - independent
      - the probabilities of one event does not change if the other event occurs
      - the sample space is unchanged
    - complement
      - the complement of event A is everything in the sample space that is not A
      - p(A^c)=1-P(A)
      - see packet
    - at most/least
      - at most means maximum
      - at least means minimum
        - complement of at least 1 is zero
    - mutually exclusive
      - two events are mutually exclusive if:
        - one event occurs, the other cannot occur
        - the intersection of the two events is empty or does not exist
        - dependant(?)
    - and
      - means muliplication or intersection
      - looking to see if something is independent
    - or
      - means addition
      - may need to use the idea of mutually exclusive or complement
# unit 5: discrete probability distributions
- random variable
  - a numerical outcome (a number) associated with a probability event
  - ex:
    - rolling a dice {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} so the number on the dice is the random variable
    - flipping a coin {H, T} if heads i get $20, if tails i pay $40. the money amounts are the random variables
- discrete random variables
  - the random variable is a discrete number
    - meaning that the number of outcomes are finite and countable
    - ex:
      - rolling a dice, and the above flipping a coin model are both discrete
- continuous random variable
  - random number is a continuous number
    - meaning that probability is usually found for a range of random variable numbers
- probability distrobution
  - very similar to a probability model
  - a list of
    - the outcomes
    - the values they take
    - and the probability for each one
  - ex: 
    - the probability distribution model for rolling a dice is the same as the probability model
    - suppose the dice has colors instead of numbers
      - 3 sides red
      - 2 blue
      - 1 green
      - win 
        - 25 for green
        - 10 for blue
        - nothing for red
- pdf
  - probability distribution function
  - calculates a single probability
- cdf
  - cumulative probability distrobution function
  - calculates a running total of summing probabilities from the beginning to the current event
  - ex:
    - when rolling a dice, the cdf of 2 would add the probabilities of rolling a 1 and a 2
  - the cdf of the ending value will equal 1 since all probabilities have to add up to 1
