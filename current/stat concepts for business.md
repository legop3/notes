# stat concepts for business

### variable types
- categorical (qualitative)
  - nominal
    - lowest level of measurment
    - no natural ranking or ordering
  - ordinal
    - values have ranking
    - examples
      - superb, good, unsatisfactory
- quantative 
  - interval
    - differences between values are meaningful
    - 0 is not meaningful
  - ratio (ratio!!!)
    - differences are meaningful
    - 0 is also meaningful
### unit 1: vocabulary
- statistics: the study of data
  
- population: the big group about which we want to gather data from
  - probably not an exact number
  - example: US adults or CSCC students
    - group of people or other subjects
- sample: the smaller subgroup of the population that the information is actually gathered from
  - you have an exact count
  - 100 students from CSCC
  - 1000 US adults
  - sample types
    - simple random sample
      - a method in which every member of the population has an equal oppurtunity to be selected
      - names in a hat, random digit dialing
    - cluster sample    
      - a method where the population is devided into groups, usually already existing groups, such as neighborhoods or classes
      - a number of clusters are randomly selected and every member in the cluster is sampled
      - CSCC survey - a number of classes are randomly selected, everyone in the class takes the survey
    - stratified sample
      - population is devided into demographic groups, then simple random samples are done in proportion to the demographic percentages
      - keeps the demographic structure in your results
      - example, CSCC survey but break it down into first year vs second year students and do surveys in proportion, 75% 1st year vs 25% second year
  - problems with sampling methods
    - these methods considered to be biased, as not everyone has an oppurtinuty to be selected
    - convenience: participants are selected based on ease, first come first serve. studies show that there is biased selection as well.
      - grabbing people off the street as they walk by
    - voluntary response: survey/poll is posted somewhere and people have to write in, log in, do it on purpose in order to respond. usually only people with very strong feelings will bother to do so.
      - surveys on reciepts, ratemyprofessor.com
      - missing the middle ground

- what are we looking for?
  - parameter: information from the population. it may be more descriptive than actually numerical.
    - ex: the number of people who like pepperoni on their pizza
  - statistic: information from the sample. we actually have this information
    - we have it because we picked a sample and asked them the question
    - ex: 75 out of 100 people like pepperoni on their pizza
  - variables: the different types of information that we are gathering from the sample.
    - ex: major, distance traveled, GPA and t-shirt size
    - types of variables
      - quantitative
        - has a numerical value
        - can do mathematical calculations on the values
        - think quantity
        - discrete
          - countable variables, the number of possible values can be counted, usually whole numbers
          - ex: distance traveled, 1 or 3 or 15 miles.
        - continuous
          - any value in a particular range such as any value from 0 to 30 - 1, 1.2, 3.6, 8.89 etc
          - cant count the number of possible values, infinite because they are numbers.
          - ex: GPA
      - qualitative (categorical, word values)
        - cannot have mathematical operations performed on them
        - ex: favorite colors, zip code, street names
          - nominal
            - based on the definitions of the values, there is no natural order in the dataset
            - ex: major, street names
          - ordinal
            - based on the definitions of the values, there is a natural order in the dataset.
            - ex: t-shirt size - small, medium, large, XL
- experiments
  - an experiment has an explanatory veriable that will hopefully show changes in the response variable, which us usually the result. the idea of an experiment is to show there is a positive effect between the two. the explanatory variable is usually the treatment
  - an experiment must have a treatment
  - random comparative experiment
    - the group of subjects will be devided into at least two groups, one group is the control group, which gets the placebo/dummy treatment and is used for comparison to the experimental groups, which are experimented on. you can have more than one experiental group.
  - treatment
    - something that is imposed on the group. it is something (for example, a drug, and exercise, etc) that is not part of their normal existence.
  - blind
    - an experiment is blind when the subject does not know which group theyre in.
  - double blind
    - neither the researcher nor the subject know what group the subject is in
  - block
    - first of all, the subject group is seperated into demographic groups
    - then a random comparative experiment is done in each group

- observational studies
  - no treatment
  - the subjects behavior is not changed (there can be an explanatory varibale and a response variable, but nothing is done to change either)
  - simply observing the subjects
  - prospective
    - a group of subjects is studied into the future throughout their lives
    - ex: a group of kindergarteners until they graduate high school
  - cross sectional
    - information about the group of subjects is gathered at a certain point in time
    - ex: census day at CSCC, they take a snapshot of all the students here.
  - retrospective
    - information about a group of subjects is gathered from past information
    - ex: determening what caused lung cancer

- confounding
  - occurs when the effects of two or more variables cannot be seperated. this can be from variables in the study such as a weight loss study that has exercise and nutrition components. is it the fact that theyre exercising more, or eating better, that theyre losing weight?
  - occurs when there are lurking variables. a lurking variable is a variable that is not studied but may affect either the explanatory or the response variable.
  - we try not to have confounding

- bias
  - bias will skew the results in a particular manner or result. for example, not zeroing a scale causes the weight to be overstated.
  - common types of bias:
    - not having a random sample (such as a simple random sample, straitified, cluster and systematic)
    - voluntary response and convenience are considered to be biased.
    - not doing a random comparative experiment
    - people may not be honest
      - self interest - information is given such that it paints the individual in the best light
      - social acceptability bias - people don't tell the truth because they don't want to be judged.
  - sampling error
    - how the sample is taken
    - certain groups are left out of the sampling frame (list of population to be sampled)
      - ex: people who dont have phones are left out of telephone polls
  - non response error
    - refusal to answer questions

# unit 2
- qualatative - categorical or word values, placed variables into categories
- quantatative - numerical values, that you could use math with.
- frequency - count of the value each time the variable takes that value
  - favorite colors:
    - 2 red
    - 5 green
    - 38 blue
    - 8 yellow
  - relative frequency
    - frequency devided by the total number of values
    - qualatative graphs - example

      FAVORITE COLOR      FREQUENCY     RELATIVE FREQUENCY

      purple                5              5/20=0.35
      blue                  7              7/20=0.35
      green                 4              4/20=0.2
      red                   4              4/20=0.2
      TOTAL                 20     

  - nominal data ^^
  - qualatative data ^^
- pie chart - used for parts of a whole
  - create a circle and mark the pieces. label each piece with the name and frequency or relative frequency.
  - excel will use the relative frequency.
- bar graph
  - can be used for any qualatative data
  - both an x and a y axis. the y axis is what frequency or relative frequency, the x axis is marked with the variable names as seperate bars.
  - a pareto graph will rder the bars in order from highest to lowest
- quantitative graphs
- stem and leaf
  - AKA stem plot
  1. decide how to devide the data. the right most digit is the leaf, and the remaining left are the stem.
  2. create a key to show how the data is devided. make sure we use a value that has different digits.
  3. draw a vertical line. for a single set of data, the stems are on the left and the leaves are on the right. the leaves are in order where the smallest is closest to the stem.
  - repeat instances of the same value (see paper notes packet for example)
- dot plot
  - requires an x axis with a nice even scale. the graph will also require a title. 
  - every graph should have a title that is meaningful.
  - an outlier is a data value that does not appear to belong in the dataset
