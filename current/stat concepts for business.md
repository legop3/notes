# stat concepts for business

## week 1
### variable types
- categorical (qualitative)
  - nominal
    - lowest level of measurment
    - no natural ranking or ordering
  - ordinal
    - values have ranking
    - examples
      - superb, good, unsatisfactory
- quantative 
  - interval
    - differences between values are meaningful
    - 0 is not meaningful
  - ratio (ratio!!!)
    - differences are meaningful
    - 0 is also meaningful
### unit 1: vocabulary
- statistics: the study of data
  
- population: the big group about which we want to gather data from
  - probably not an exact number
  - example: US adults or CSCC students
    - group of people or other subjects
- sample: the smaller subgroup of the population that the information is actually gathered from
  - you have an exact count
  - 100 students from CSCC
  - 1000 US adults
  - sample types
    - simple random sample
      - a method in which every member of the population has an equal oppurtunity to be selected
      - names in a hat, random digit dialing
    - cluster sample    
      - a method where the population is devided into groups, usually already existing groups, such as neighborhoods or classes
      - a number of clusters are randomly selected and every member in the cluster is sampled
      - CSCC survey - a number of classes are randomly selected, everyone in the class takes the survey
    - stratified sample
      - population is devided into demographic groups, then simple random samples are done in proportion to the demographic percentages
      - keeps the demographic structure in your results
      - example, CSCC survey but break it down into first year vs second year students and do surveys in proportion, 75% 1st year vs 25% second year
  - problems with sampling methods
    - these methods considered to be biased, as not everyone has an oppurtinuty to be selected
    - convenience: participants are selected based on ease, first come first serve. studies show that there is biased selection as well.
      - grabbing people off the street as they walk by
    - voluntary response: survey/poll is posted somewhere and people have to write in, log in, do it on purpose in order to respond. usually only people with very strong feelings will bother to do so.
      - surveys on reciepts, ratemyprofessor.com
      - missing the middle ground

- what are we looking for?
  - parameter: information from the population. it may be more descriptive than actually numerical.
    - ex: the number of people who like pepperoni on their pizza
  - statistic: information from the sample. we actually have this information
    - we have it because we picked a sample and asked them the question
    - ex: 75 out of 100 people like pepperoni on their pizza
  - variables: the different types of information that we are gathering from the sample.
    - ex: major, distance traveled, GPA and t-shirt size
    - types of variables
      - quantitative
        - has a numerical value
        - can do mathematical calculations on the values
        - think quantity
        - discrete
          - countable variables, the number of possible values can be counted, usually whole numbers
          - ex: distance traveled, 1 or 3 or 15 miles.
        - continuous
          - any value in a particular range such as any value from 0 to 30 - 1, 1.2, 3.6, 8.89 etc
          - cant count the number of possible values, infinite because they are numbers.
          - ex: GPA
      - qualitative (categorical, word values)
        - cannot have mathematical operations performed on them
        - ex: favorite colors, zip code, street names
          - nominal
            - based on the definitions of the values, there is no natural order in the dataset
            - ex: major, street names
          - ordinal
            - based on the definitions of the values, there is a natural order in the dataset.
            - ex: t-shirt size
