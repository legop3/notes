# ch. 49: african art and global trade (first half)
- foreign trade began to change the societies of africa
  - connecting african cultures to europe and asia
- the beginnings of slavery
## foreign exports and local art: the sapi
- the sapi were the first west africans to encounter european sailing vessels
- began with mostly sculpted elephant ivory
- portugese people were commissioning sapi artists to sculp luxury items out of ivory
  - lidded bowls were one of the most popular things
    - known as salt cellars
    - salt was an expensive commodity
    - salt cellars were displayed on the tables of the rich
    - the sapi had little to no use for these items, they were made completely for export
    - they were generally very intricate, not just simple bowls or dishes
    - one fairly complete example:
      - is about 6 inches across
      - weighs about 3 pounds empty
      - has most of the container in a sphere on top
        - surrounded by seated figures underneath it
          - four of them are sapi women, and four of them are portugese men
          - scarification is across the chests and torsos of the female figures
      - contains references to the portugese violence on the sapi
        - by the time this work was made, portugese men had alredy abducted sapi women
- the sapi stopped exporting their artworks to europe by the middle of the sixteenth century
  - because of all the violence that they experienced from them
- stone carvings and sculptures were made by populations farther inland than the sapi
  - populations such as the temne and kissi
  - one of these stone carvings, in the british museum, shows a figure in a reclined position
    - there are markings across their torso, lines
      - these lines could be twisted ropes or scarification patterns
      - this piece is thought to be made by a sapi before 1550
    - stone carvings like these are displayed at funerals of distiguished leaders in temne and kissi communities still today
    - this particular carving might be a subject lying at his own funeral
